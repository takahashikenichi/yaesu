Yaesu
====
Yaesu is my own project to produce the easy Markdown-Text editor which can be used at my company.

## Description
By the reason of security, a big Japanese company has a lot of access restrictions to defend a lot of confidential document from outside attack.　My company also has. Evernote, Dropbox and GoogleDrive are prohibited at my company.　If I couldn't use those tools, I make　it.

## Demo
TBD.

## VS. 
Yaesu is like Atom editor, but workｓ lightly.
Yaesu is like Evernote, but works without outside servers.
